Description is on Computational Physics Blog: https://compphys.go.ro/augmented-plane-waves/

### TOOLS

The project compiles on Windows with Visual Studio 2026 (the code can be compiled with older versions starting with VS 2015, but it's currently maintained with VS 2026 and C++ 17 or higher).

### LIBRARIES

The program requires the typical VC++ runtime libraries.
Additional libraries needed are VTK https://vtk.org/ and wxWidgets https://wxwidgets.org/.
